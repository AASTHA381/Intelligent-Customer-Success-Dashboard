### 1. Dashboard Overview
- View key metrics: total customers, active customers, high-risk customers
- Monitor average health scores and recent interactions
- Analyze trends with interactive charts

### 2. Customer Analysis
- View all customers with health scores and churn predictions
- Identify high-risk customers requiring immediate attention
- See AI-generated intervention recommendations

### 3. Testing Examples
The dashboard includes 4 built-in test scenarios:

#### Test 1: High Risk Customer
```json
{
  "tenure_months": 3,
  "monthly_revenue": 45,
  "total_interactions": 8,
  "support_tickets": 6,
  "last_login_days": 21,
  "feature_usage_score": 1.2
}
```
**Expected Results:**
- High churn risk (>70%)
- Low health score (<50)
- Recommendations: Personal outreach, training sessions

#### Test 2: Healthy Customer
```json
{
  "tenure_months": 24,
  "monthly_revenue": 350,
  "total_interactions": 85,
  "support_tickets": 1,
  "last_login_days": 1,
  "feature_usage_score": 4.8
}
```
**Expected Results:**
- Low churn risk (<20%)
- High health score (>90)
- Minimal intervention needed

#### Test 3: New Customer
```json
{
  "tenure_months": 1,
  "monthly_revenue": 150,
  "total_interactions": 5,
  "support_tickets": 2,
  "last_login_days": 3,
  "feature_usage_score": 2.5
}
```
**Expected Results:**
- Medium churn risk (40-60%)
- Moderate health score (60-80)
- Onboarding recommendations

#### Test 4: Churn Prediction Test
```json
{
  "tenure_months": 6,
  "monthly_revenue": 75,
  "total_interactions": 15,
  "support_tickets": 4,
  "last_login_days": 14,
  "feature_usage_score": 2.1
}
```
**Expected Results:**
- Medium-high churn risk (50-70%)
- Fair health score (50-70)
- Re-engagement strategies

## 🤖 AI Models

### 1. Churn Predictor
- **Algorithm**: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Features**: Tenure, revenue, interactions, support tickets, login frequency, feature usage
- **Output**: Churn probability (0-1) and risk level (Low/Medium/High)

### 2. Health Scorer
- **Components**: Engagement, usage, satisfaction, financial, support scores
- **Weights**: Engagement (30%), Usage (25%), Satisfaction (20%), Financial (15%), Support (10%)
- **Output**: Health score (0-100) and status (Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent)

### 3. Intervention Recommender
- **Strategy**: Rule-based AI with personalized recommendations
- **Categories**: Personal outreach, product education, support enhancement, commercial, engagement
- **Output**: Prioritized action items with categories

# Test health scoring
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/health-score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tenure_months": 24, "monthly_revenue": 350, "total_interactions": 85, "support_tickets": 1, "last_login_days": 1, "feature_usage_score": 4.8}'
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 5000 already in use**
   ```bash
   # Change port in app.py
   app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
   ```

2. **Module import errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're in the backend directory
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Data loading errors**
   - Verify CSV files exist in `/data` directory
   - Check file permissions

### Performance Optimization
- The system handles up to 10,000 customers efficiently
- For larger datasets, consider implementing database storage
- Use caching for frequently accessed predictions
